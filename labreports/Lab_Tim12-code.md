## 1. Overview
The business problem we were tasked with solving was the process of having a meal from an on-campus provider be delivered to a specific classroom. Me and my interviewees came up with business, user, functional, non-functional, and system requirements to solve this problem and plan for a system that could execute this task. The User must give the specified information to the system in order for it to return with the confirmation order information. The system will perform multiple tasks, including taking an order, estimating delievery time, and sending the order to employees to carryout in that time.
